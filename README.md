# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

## Project Description
This project performs comprehensive analysis and visualization of global COVID-19 data, exploring trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries. The goal is to gain insights from the data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create visual representations of key metrics to communicate findings effectively.

## Objectives
- Load and clean COVID-19 data sourced from *Our World in Data*.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Visualize the data using charts such as line graphs and bar charts to highlight global trends.
- Focus on selected countries for in-depth analysis and comparison of vaccination coverage.
- Present insights in an easy-to-understand narrative with accompanying visuals.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** – Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas** – Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** – Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn** – Built on top of Matplotlib for statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive computing environment for presenting the analysis.
- **NumPy** – Library for handling numerical data.

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-19-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd covid-19-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis:
   ```
   jupyter notebook covid_data_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Insights and Reflections
- The analysis showed clear trends in vaccination coverage across different countries, with some countries progressing faster than others in their vaccination efforts.
- There was a strong correlation between vaccination rates and the reduction in COVID-19 cases, highlighting the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
- Challenges in the data included missing values for some countries and inconsistent reporting of vaccination numbers.

This project is an attempt to visualize and interpret COVID-19 data in a meaningful way, which can aid in decision-making and understanding the global pandemic better.
